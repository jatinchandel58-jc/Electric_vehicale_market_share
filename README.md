# Electric_vehicle_market_share
* Overview

This project focuses on data cleaning and market share analysis of registered vehicles across different U.S. states.
The goal was to clean and standardize raw vehicle registration data, analyze the adoption rate of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and gain insights into the distribution of alternative fuel vehicles.

The project was completed using SQL for data processing and visualization tools (like Excel/Power BI/Tableau) for insights and charts.

* Project Objectives
  1. Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values, zeroes, and other data quality issues.

Standardized state names and corrected inconsistent entries.

Ensured numeric and percentage columns were properly formatted.

  2. Market Share Analysis

Calculated the percentage of EVs, PHEVs, HEVs, and Gasoline vehicles for each state.

Identified the Top 5 states with the highest EV adoption rates (EVs as % of total registered vehicles).

Compared California’s EV adoption against other major states like Texas, Florida, and New York.

  3. Trends & Insights

Analyzed which alternative fuels (Biodiesel, Ethanol, Hydrogen, etc.) have a significant market presence.

Created visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and maps to show:

EV distribution by state

Share of each fuel type

State-wise adoption growth patterns
